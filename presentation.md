## For Peer Evaluators

- Recall: each component can be only claimed by one group member
- I created this project alone
- I only claim to complete **user interaction**, including:
  - Click to add route nodes
  - Drag to edit route nodes
  - A* pathfinding updates instantly on node movement
  - UI provides immediate feedback on cost and ridership
  - Multiple mapping layers to help plan out building routes
  - Save/load system
- You only will grade me on that category
- All other categories you should score with a 1, as I do not claim to complete
  them
